# Ember REST Example

This is a simple Rails 3.2 app created to demonstrate using Ember.js with a basic RESTful persistence strategy.

The app itself is a single-page Ember.js take on Rails CRUD scaffolding. It is one of several similar examples I'm creating
to try out Ember.js and different persistence strategies.
